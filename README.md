This web app uses the Google Maps API and PV Watts to estimate the surface area of a roof and how much solar radiation it receives in the course of a full year. This data is then used to price the roof so the home owner can lease the roof to solar installers to put solar panels on it. This can be very useful to home owners who do not want to go solar but they still want to monetize their roof if it is well suited for solar panels.
